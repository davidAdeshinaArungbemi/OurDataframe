# OurDataframe
A dataframe library written entirely in C++, inspired by Python's pandas library.<br>
This project is built to support the MLA library enabling users to carry out:<br>
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Data tranformation(cutting either by rows or columns or both, removing and adding values)
- Reading and writing data from csv files
- Exploratory analysis(collecting info on nulls/non-nulls in dataset, summary statistics, etc)
- Arithmetic operations with data(Int or Float)


Functions are self-explanatory by their names. Check the our-dataframe.hpp file for functions available
